# DDS Case Study 2

We work for DDSAnalytics, an analytics company specializing in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Our duties include but are not limited to workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees, and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business green lights the project, they have tasked our data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data.

# Monthly Income
Our model was fitted with 5 variables which gave us a RMSE of ~935 dollars. 

# Attrition
Our K-Nearest Neighbor Model used K = 11 and gave us a Sensitivity of 100% and a Specificity of 77%
